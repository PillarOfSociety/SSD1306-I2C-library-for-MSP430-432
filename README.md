# SSD1306 I2C library for MSP430 & 432
- Example in file "msp432_ssd1306_main.c"
- Connections for both MSP shows in file "ssd1306_i2c_lib".
- If you're using MSP430 just replace both file from folder "430_i2c_lib" with file "ssd1306_i2c_lib".
- If you're using MSP432 don't replace anything.

*This is a work in progress. My intent is to make this work with the x32 pixel version of the SSD1306 as well.

*Initial development and testing was done on at TI MSP-EXP430FR5994 launchpad  (pins 7.0 and 7.1 are the I2C)

*Using CCS 9.3
